# URL Shortener

The URL Shortener is an application where the user can provide a URL and the applcation will create a shortened version of that URL. Both versions of the link are stored in a database so that the user can use the shortened URL to navigate the web.

## To Use

Go to https://matty22urlshortener.herokuapp.com/. The instructions there will tell the user to put the long URL as a param at the end of the URL. An example might be: https://matty22urlshortener.herokuapp.com/http://www.google.com. The application will return an object that looks something like this: `{"original_url": "https://www.google.com", "short_url": "https://matty22urlshortener.herokuapp.com/52"}`
